## Introduction

Vegetation surveys for this project were designed to estimate the quantities of beaver-preferred woody and herbaceous plant species along stream reaches.

## Methods

### Study area

These surveys occurred in the Upper Green River Watershed, characterized by managed forest and limited human infrastructure. The Charley Creek Natural Area Preserve is DNR land .... when last harvested?

Four study reaches were selected for slope, and length. Etc Ect (map of reaches).

### Survey

We conducted surveys in fall. We estimated percent cover for all tree, shrub, and herbaceous plants species (excluding moss) in 20-ft radius plots. In addition, within each plot we noted observations of beaver and elk browse according to plant species, recorded individual tree trunk sizes and estimated overall tree canopy cover. We considered percent cover to be the portion of the plot covered by the full extent of the above ground foliage of plants of the same species combined then recorded as a single ocular estimate. We included any part of the foliage within the plot, even if the stem/trunk was out of the plot. When species occurred in less than 1% of the plot, their presence was recorded as "trace." During analysis, we converted occurrences of "trace" to the numeric value of 0.5% to allow for the inclusion of trace observations in numeric calculations. All tree trunk sizes were recorded as diameter at breast height (DBH) using diameter tapes wrapped around the tree truck at 4 feet above the forest floor. If a tree was not yet four feet tall it was counted and recorded as a sapling.

We located the plots by first delineating eight 150-ft transects on opposite banks and perpendicular to flow beginning at four locations along each reach. Pairs of transects were located at the most upstream and downstream end of the reach and within the reach at locations about 50-100 feet from the ends. Then, along each transects, 20-ft radius circular plots were centered at 20 ft, 75 ft, and 130 ft from water's edge (@fig-reach). We also recorded the latitude and longitude of the center of each plot with a BadElf Flex interfaced with an iPhone via Bluetooth.

## Findings

#| echo: false
n_plots <-spcover_q  %>%  
  select(plot_id)   %>% 
  n_distinct() 

n_obs <-spcover_q  %>%  
  select(observation_date.only)   %>% 
  n_distinct() 

n_reaches <-spcover_q  %>%  
  select(reach)   %>% 
  n_distinct() 

name_reach<-spcover_q  %>%  
  select(reach, plot_id)   %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  group_by( reach) %>% 
  summarise(freq = n()) %>% 
  filter(freq != 24) %>% 
  pull(reach)

  unique() %>% 
  group_by( reach) %>% 
  summarise(freq = n()) %>% 
  filter(freq != 24) %>% 
  pull(freq)
```

We completed surveys along `r n_reaches` reaches of the Charley Creek natural area totaling `r n_plots` plots over `r n_obs` sampling events which occurred during the fall of `r year(min(spcover_q$observation_date.only))` and `r year(max(spcover_q$observation_date.only))`. We completed all 24 plots along \[name and name\]. We completed 22 plots along the `r name_reach`, where we excluded one plot with an active ground hive and another that crossed a neighboring stream channel, and 23 plots at \[\] that also had a plot on the far side of a separate neighboring stream.

### Species richness

Overall teams observed `r n_species` different species in the area, `r n_treesp` tree species and the rest shrubs and herbaceous plants (@fig-freq-cov). X number of species occurred in 75% of the plots or more, including of \[most frequent\] which was in \[91\] of the \[94\] plots. X number of species were only observed once, often in trace amounts.

On average plots contained `r round(mean(n_plotspecies$n_plotspecies))` species with as few as `r min(n_plotspecies$n_plotspecies)` and as many as `r max(n_plotspecies$n_plotspecies)` planted species recorded.

Coverage ranged from trace amounts (recorded as 0.5%) to `r cov_max`%. The most frequently occurring species horriblous,

### Herbivory

We found evidence of beaver herbivory in x number of plots, all of which were located within plots X feet from water's edge. herbivory occured on X species, X species, and X species

### Tree sizes

Tree sizes ranged from sapling to

### Canopy cover

Total canopy cover over each plot averaged X \[median X\] and ranged from X to X. Figure b)

Total cover increased slightly as distances from the stream increased with plots 20ft from water's edge vs plots 130ft from water's edge
